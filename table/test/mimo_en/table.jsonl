Feature 1: The reorder point is automatically calculated, scientifically calculated, and professionally designed; Feature 2: Automatically prompts for timely replenishment; Feature 3: The first row prominently and automatically displays the day's ending inventory data and inventory status. Daily consumption, minimum safety stock, reorder point, today's ending inventory, inventory status, total inbound, total outbound, ending quantity, etc., are all automatically generated without the need to input data. Note: The reorder point method is suitable for products with relatively stable, frequent daily demand and large sales volumes.
