Up to and including the 2017-2018 season, the Grade of Execution (GOE) scoring system for each program element ranged between -3 and +3. Starting with the 2018-2019 season, the GOE was expanded to range between -5 and +5. Hence, the International Skating Union (ISU) have restarted all records from the 2018-2019 season and all previous statistics have been marked as historical. Accordingly, this page lists only the highest scores achieved from the 2018-2019 season onwards, using the -5/+5 GOE scoring range. The following lists are included:\nNote: In the case of personal best lists, only one score is listed for any one skater, i.e. their personal best. The absolute best lists may include more than one score for the same skater. The ISU only recognizes the best scores that are set at international competitions run under the ISU's rules, and does not recognize, for example, scores that are obtained at national figure skating championships. The competitions recognized by the ISU are: Winter Olympics (including the team event), Youth Olympics (including the team event), World Championships, World Junior Championships, European Championships, Four Continents Championships, GP events, Junior GP events, Challenger Series events, and World Team Trophy."}}

The first film to be sent to AMPAS by Iceland was Land and Sons which was released in Iceland in 1980. Since then, Iceland has sent in a film every year. Only one Icelandic film, Börn náttúrunnar (Children of Nature), directed by Friðrik Þór Friðriksson, has received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. However, a second, Djúpið (The Deep), made the nine-film shortlist in 2012, and a third, Síðasti bærinn (The Last Farm) by Rúnar Rúnarsson, was also nominated for Best Live Action Short in 2006. Friðrik Þór Friðriksson's films have been selected to represent Iceland six times- more than any other Icelandic director. Ágúst Guðmundsson, Baltasar Kormákur and Hrafn Gunnlaugsson have each represented Iceland four times. In 1990, Guðný Halldórsdóttir became the first Icelandic woman to represent the country."}}

The USL is sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation (U.S. Soccer) as a Division II Professional League since 2017, placing it under Major League Soccer (Division I) in the hierarchy. The USL is headquartered in Tampa, Florida. The league is owned and operated by United Soccer League (originally United Soccer Leagues) and was formed as result of the merger of their USL First (USL-1) and Second Divisions (USL-2), following the controversial 2010 season which saw neither the USL-1 nor the North American Soccer League (NASL) receive Division II sanctioning from the USSF, resulting in the temporary USSF Division 2 Pro League. United Soccer Leagues stated that the merger would strengthen the league's position within the American professional soccer landscape through stability, commercial growth and the professional development of soccer in four main regions throughout the United States and Canada. Formerly known as United Soccer League (USL) and USL Pro, in January 2013, United Soccer Leagues and MLS reached an agreement to integrate the USL league competition with the MLS Reserve League, primarily to improve player development in North America, strengthen league competition and build ties between leagues in the American soccer pyramid. This multi-year deal encourages MLS and USL team affiliations and player loans, aiming to have more games for teams and developing players. As of the 2020 season, 14 USL Championship teams are affiliated to MLS teams. Most teams have an affiliate in either the USL Championship or third-level USL League One (USL1), but Columbus Crew SC, FC Cincinnati, Los Angeles FC, Montreal Impact, Nashville SC, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC have no affiliated team in these leagues."}}

FK Lyn elected to file for bankruptcy on 30 June, following an extended period of financial distress, and formally withdrew from the league on 7 July. Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the competition, all games involving Lyn was annulled and the team placed at the bottom of the standings. Follo did not finish their licensing application for the 2011 season before the time limit of September 15, and were thus relegated at the end of the season even though they finished outside the relegation zone. As a result of this, Sandnes Ulf, which was the best placed team of those inside the relegation zone, avoided relegation.

The Nashville Predators made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. The Pittsburgh Penguins increased their post-season appearance streak to twelve seasons, the current longest streak. The Vegas Golden Knights became the first team to make the playoffs in their inaugural season in the league since the 1979-80 Hartford Whalers and the Edmonton Oilers. They also became the first expansion team to make the playoffs in their inaugural season since the 1967 NHL expansion. From there, they eventually became the first team since the 1967-68 St. Louis Blues to win their respective conference, and reach the Stanley Cup Finals in their inaugural season. The only difference is that the 1967-68 season through to the 1969-70 season ensured that an expansion team would be able to reach the Stanley Cup Finals. For the fourth time in league history (2000, 2001, 2007), only two Original Six teams, the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs, clinched a berth for the playoffs.

While there is tremendous variability encountered in both wild and cultivated coffee plants, there are a few varieties and cultivars that are commercially important due to various unique and inherent traits such as disease resistance and fruit yield. These unique traits are what producers use to select breeds when developing crops. Therefore, at a micro level, breed selection is critical to the success of a producer and is one of the key components of cup quality. At a macro level, the viability of the coffee industry as a whole is dependent upon breed selection. Already, the majority of coffee produced originates from producers using selected breeds. For this reason, breed selection is an important aspect of sustainability within coffee production."}}

It is traditionally the final event of a track meet. At top class events, the first 500 metres is run in lanes. Start lines are thus staggered over a greater distance than in an individual 400 metres race; the runners then typically move to the inside of the track. The slightly longer 4 × 440 yards relay was a formerly run British and American event, until metrication was completed in the 1970s. Relay race runners typically carry a relay baton which they must transfer between teammates. Runners have a 20 m box (usually marked with blue lines) in which to transfer the baton. The first transfer is made within the staggered lane lines; for the second and third transfers, runners typically line up across the track despite the fact that runners are usually running in line on the inside of the track. This prevents confusion and collisions during transfer. Unlike the 4 × 100 m relay, runners in the 4 × 400 typically look back and grasp the baton from the incoming runner, due to the fatigue of the incoming runner, and the wider margins allowed by the longer distance of the race. Consequently, disqualification is rare. As runners have a running start, split times cannot be compared to individual 400 m performances."}}

The Simon Wiesenthal Center has advocated classifying suicide bombings, including those committed by Palestinians, as Crimes against humanity, a position adopted by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch in 2002.

It is one of the three pillars of the Asian Land Transport Infrastructure Development (ALTID) project, endorsed by the ESCAP commission at its 48th session in 1992, comprising Asian Highway, Trans-Asian Railway (TAR) and facilitation of land transport projects. Agreements have been signed by 32 countries to allow the highway to cross the continent and also reach to Europe. Some of the countries taking part in the highway project are India (Look-East connectivity projects), Sri Lanka, Pakistan, China, Iran, Japan, South Korea and Bangladesh. Most of the funding comes from the larger, more advanced Asian nations like Japan, India , Nepal, Taiwan, South Korea and China as well as international agencies such as the Asian Development Bank. The project aims to make maximum use of the continent's existing highways to avoid the construction of newer ones, except in cases where missing routes necessitate their construction. Project Monitor, an Asian infrastructure news website, has commented that early beneficiaries of the Asian Highway project are the planners within the national land transport department of the participating countries [since] it assists them in planning the most cost-effective and efficient routes to promote domestic and international trade. Non-coastal areas, which are often negligible, are the other beneficiaries. However, in the mid-2000s some transportation experts were sceptical about the viability of the project given the economic and political climate in both South and Southeast Asia. The Asian Highway Network is going to take over 2 projects, one is the AH 45 and the other is the new AH 45A. AH 45A is the new highway all over Asia from Tonghua to Sana'a."}}

The latter differed from its British counterpart in that it included the previously released English-language versions of She Loves You and I Want to Hold Your Hand, rather than the German-language version found on the British Rarities compilation. The American edition of the box set was a limited edition of only 3000 numbered copies.

Vanderbilt was the only school to claim a championship and remain undefeated against all opponents. It posted the nation's number one defense as measured by points against per game and was retroactively selected for a national championship by selector Clyde Berryman. Intersectionalism was popular. Vanderbilt fought Michigan to a scoreless tie at the inaugural game at Dudley Field, the first football stadium in the south in the style of the Eastern schools.

Along with Oliver McCall and Nikolai Valuev, he is also the only world heavyweight champion to have never been knocked down in any fight.

The terms can vary in length from state to state. Most states appoint a poet laureate for a one- or two-year term, fewer to several years, and some states appoint a poet to a lifetime tenure. Two states, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, previously had such posts but abolished them in 2003. Michigan had a single poet laureate from 1952-1959. There has never been an official State Poet Laureate in Massachusetts or New Mexico. While Idaho does not have a post of poet laureate, per se, the state appoints a Writer in Residence, which can be held by a novelist or poet.

After lengthy legal proceedings, the team's top rider Alejandro Valverde was given a global two-year ban on May 31, backdated to January 1. Since he was, in essence, banned for all of the 2010 season, the results he obtained before the Court of Arbitration for Sport's decision came down were vacated and awarded to previously second-placed riders."}}

The Quality Council of India (QCI) was set up as a public private partnership model on the model existing in Netherlands at the time, where although the NAB was not owned by the government, yet it was supported by it and was exceedingly used as a third party agency to improve quality in departments and industry. QCI thus, came to be organized as an independent autonomous body that worked towards assuring quality standards across all spheres of economic and social activities. Key industry associations, i.e. Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), Confederation of Indian Industry(CII) and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) became the promoters of the organizers and QCI got established under the Societies Registration Act in 1997 to provide accreditation services in various sectors for product, services and persons. The Council is independent and works under the directions of its Governing Body (GB) having equal representation of government, industry and industry associations. It does not get funded by the government and is a self-sustaining non-profit organization with its own Memorandum of Association (MOA) and Rules.

The 2014 Broadway transfer earned a Tony Award for Best Play nomination in 2015. The play is centered on sociopolitical themes such as Islamophobia and the self-identity of Muslim-American citizens. It focuses on a dinner party between four people with very different backgrounds. As discussion turns to politics and religion, the mood quickly becomes heated. Described as a combustible powder keg of identity politics, the play depicts racial and ethnic prejudices that secretly persist in even the most progressive cultural circles. It is also said to depict the challenge for upwardly mobile Muslim Americans in the post-9/11 America. Productions have included performances by Aasif Mandvi and Erik Jensen."}}

Its period of glory at the world stage began in the late 1940s / early 1950s. At the 1948 Olympics in London, the France team led by Robert Busnel won an Olympic silver medal, the first Olympic medal in its history. The French finished second only to the United States. In the wake of this Olympic medal, France, led by captain André Vacheresse, won three consecutive medals, including silver at the EuroBasket 1949, and bronze at the EuroBasket 1951 and the EuroBasket 1953. The following years were less glorious. France's basketball team seemingly declined gradually to disappear almost completely from the two major world competitions during the 1960s and 1970s."}}

With only 32 cars on the starting grid it was the smallest field for the race since only 48 cars faced the starter for the 1988 Tooheys 1000.

Larry Perkins and Russell Ingall driving the #11 Castrol Commodore won the 1995 Tooheys 1000 in what was literally a last to first effort.

They compete in the Pac-12 Conference of NCAA Division I and are currently coached by Sean Miller. Arizona has a long and rich basketball history. The program came to national prominence under the tutelage of former head coach Lute Olson (1983-2007), who established the program as among America's elite in college basketball. One writer referred to UA as Point Guard U because the school has produced successful guards like Steve Kerr, Damon Stoudamire, Khalid Reeves, Mike Bibby, Jason Terry, Gilbert Arenas, Jason Gardner, Jerryd Bayless, and T. J. McConnell, among others. From 1985 to 2009, the Arizona basketball team reached the NCAA Division I Tournament for 25 consecutive years, two years shy of North Carolina's record with 27. Despite having their 1999 and 2008 appearances later vacated by the NCAA, the media still cites Arizona's streak, and simply notes the changes. The Wildcats have reached the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament on four occasions (1988, 1994, 1997, and 2001). They have also made two appearances in the National Championship (won over Kentucky Wildcats in 1997, lost to Duke Blue Devils in 2001). In Pac-10 play, former head coach Lute Olson currently holds the record for most wins as a Pac-10 coach with 327. In addition, the team has won sixteen Pac-10/12 regular season championship titles and seven Pac-10/12 tournament championship titles. Arizona also holds the distinction of recording five out of the seven 17-1 Pac-10 seasons (one-loss seasons)."}}

The 2002 Winter Olympics and the 2002 Paralympic Games were both organized by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC), the first time in Olympic and Paralympic history that both events were organized by a single committee. Utah became the fifth state in the United States to host the Olympic Games, after Missouri, New York, California, and Georgia. These were the first Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Jacques Rogge. The opening ceremony was held on February 8, 2002, and sporting competitions were held up until the closing ceremony on February 24, 2002. Production for both ceremonies was designed by Seven Nielsen, and music for both ceremonies was directed by Mark Watters. Salt Lake City became the most populous area ever to have hosted the Winter Olympics, although the two subsequent host cities' populations were larger. Following a trend, the 2002 Olympic Winter Games were also larger than all prior Winter Games, with 10 more events than the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Norway won the most gold medals while Germany won the most number of medals. The Salt Lake Games faced a bribery scandal and some local opposition during the bid. Nevertheless, from sporting and business standpoints, this was one of the most successful Winter Olympiads in history; records were set in both the broadcasting and marketing programs."}}

The dual-slalom format - which involved knock-out heats with two riders on the parallel courses in each heat - evolved into four-cross (with four riders on a single course per heat) in 2002 before being dropped after the 2011 season. Riders win points according to their placing in each event. The reigning series leaders in each class are identified by a special jersey.

The city has an estimated population of 1,752,286 over a land area of about 525 square kilometres (203 square miles). Budapest is both a city and county, and forms the centre of the Budapest metropolitan area, which has an area of 7,626 square kilometres (2,944 square miles) and a population of 3,303,786, comprising 33% of the population of Hungary. The history of Budapest began when an early Celtic settlement transformed into the Roman town of Aquincum, the capital of Lower Pannonia. The Hungarians arrived in the territory in the late 9th century, but the area was pillaged by the Mongols in 1241-42. Re-established Buda became one of the centres of Renaissance humanist culture by the 15th century. The Battle of Mohács, in 1526, was followed by nearly 150 years of Ottoman rule. After the reconquest of Buda in 1686, the region entered a new age of prosperity, with Pest-Buda becoming a global city after the unification of Buda, Óbuda, and Pest on 17 November 1873, with the name 'Budapest' given to the new capital. Budapest also became the co-capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a great power that dissolved in 1918, following World War I. The city was the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the Battle of Budapest in 1945, and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Budapest is an Alpha − global city with strengths in commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment. It is Hungary's financial centre and was ranked as the second fastest-developing urban economy in Europe."}}

It was previously the biggest free ticketed music event in Europe, until a fee for tickets was introduced in 2018, and always includes a host of new artists. The festival is a spin-off of Radio 1's One Big Sunday, where in each Sunday during July and August, a different town would host the roadshow, usually next to a beach or in a large park. These were also free, but non-ticketed. Both the One Big Sunday and One Big Weekend events are successors to the Radio 1 Roadshow which toured the country during every summer from 1973 until the 1990s. Originally a One Big Weekend would run twice a year. Saturday was dedicated to dance music and Sunday to bands. Since 2005, the dance day has been replaced by a second day of bands. In 2005, the dance music took place on a second stage on the Saturday only and in 2006 it took place off site at a club on the Saturday night. The Saturday of dance music was effectively reinstated for the 2013 event in Northern Ireland, but with the day of electronic dance being held on the Friday of the weekend. The Big Weekend was replaced by a larger festival in 2012, named Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, with a crowd capacity of 50,000."}}

The band has sold nearly 30 million albums worldwide, and has fans affectionately known as gearheads (derived from the band's gear-shaped logo). Many of their songs, including Let It Ride, You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet, Takin' Care of Business, Hey You, and Roll on Down the Highway, still receive play on classic-rock stations. The original lineup consisted of Randy Bachman (lead guitar, lead vocals), Fred Turner (bass guitar, lead vocals), Tim Bachman (guitar, vocals) and Robbie Bachman (drums). This lineup released two albums in 1973. The second and most commercially successful lineup featured Blair Thornton (lead guitar), in place of Tim Bachman. This lineup released four albums between 1974 and 1977, including two that reached the Top 5 in the U.S. pop charts, as well as the band's only U.S. No. 1 single (You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet). Subsequent lineups enjoyed only moderate success. After the band went into a hiatus in 2005, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner reunited in 2009 to tour and collaborate on a new album.

His first book , An Astronomicall Description of the Late Comet , was published in 1619 and described the comet of the previous year . He was already known by this time to Sir Henry Savile and Henry Briggs ( who Savile appointed as his first geometry professor ) . After his appointment to the chair , Bainbridge also lectured and practised in medicine . Although only a few other publications of his survive , they have been said to reveal an acute intellect and deep learning . He demonstrated a knowledge of contemporary developments in astronomy , such as the work of Johannes Kepler , and studied Arabic to acquire details of astronomical observations in ancient sources . He also exposed the many mistakes that Joseph Scaliger made when attempting to explain the origins of the Julian calendar in observations of Sirius from ancient Egypt - an achievement that was recorded by his successor John Greaves on his memorial in Merton College Chapel\"", "John Greaves,1643-48,Balliol College,Merton College,\"Greaves began studying astronomical texts in Greek , Arabic and Persian at about the time that he was appointed to a fellowship of Merton College in 1624 . He was appointed Professor of Geometry at Gresham College , London , in 1631 . He undertook an expedition to the Levant region of the Mediterranean in 1637 to carry out astronomical observations and to acquire learned books in oriental languages for William Laud ( Chancellor of the University of Oxford and Archbishop of Canterbury ) . Some of the instruments he took with him are now held by the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford . He returned home in 1640 , and succeeded Bainbridge in 1643 . During the English Civil War , he was expelled from Oxford by the Parliamentary authorities in charge of the university in 1648 , and moved to London , where he published various works drawing upon the research carried out in his expedition . He was a friend of Seth Ward and was able to help him succeed to the chair that he had been forced to vacate\"", "Seth Ward,1649-60,University of Cambridge ( Sidney Sussex College ),Wadham College and Trinity College,\"When still an undergraduate , Ward impressed John Bainbridge ( the first astronomy professor ) during a mathematical disputation . Ward was appointed as university lecturer in mathematics at Cambridge in 1643 , but was deprived of his fellowship in the following year for refusing to agree to the religious oaths required by the Parliamentary authorities . He spent the following years tutoring and improving his mathematical knowledge , before succeeding his friend John Greaves in the Savilian chair , with Greaves 's assistance . University lectures in astronomy were resumed under Ward , who was the first Savilian professor to teach the Copernican discovery that the Earth and other planets revolved around the Sun . He studied comets and the movements of the planets , observing them from the room at the top of the tower of Wadham College in which he lived ; he also preached and published theological works . He was elected Principal of Jesus College , Oxford , in 1657 , but Oliver Cromwell installed Francis Howell instead , raising Ward 's stipend as compensation . He was President of Trinity College , Oxford , from 1659 but resigned 1660 at The Restoration in favour of his ejected predecessor ; he also gave up the professorship in the same year . He later became Bishop of Exeter and then Bishop of Salisbury , where he did much to restore the cathedrals , but did not continue his astronomical studies\"", "Christopher Wren,1661-73,Wadham College,All Souls College,\"As an undergraduate , Wren joined the circle of mathematicians and natural scientists at Wadham under the leadership of the Warden , John Wilkins . He developed an interest for telescopes and astronomy , building with Wilkins an 80-foot ( 24 m ) long instrument to observe the Moon in 1655 . Oliver Cromwell appointed Wren in 1657 as Professor of Geometry at Gresham College , London , on the recommendation of Wilkins ; Wren lectured on Saturn ( the appearance and phases of which he had earlier studied ) , Kepler 's works , light , and lenses . He provided partial solutions in 1658 to problems relating to curves set by Blaise Pascal , the answers to which would help calculations for planetary orbits . He resigned from Gresham College upon his appointment to the Savilian chair , lecturing on topics such as spheres and navigation . He developed an interest in architecture from his mathematical studies , with early work including the chapel of Pembroke College , Cambridge , and the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford . His architectural skills led to his role in rebuilding London after the Great Fire of 1666 ( including St Paul 's Cathedral ) and his appointment as Surveyor of the King 's Works in 1669 . Isaac Newton described him as one of the foremost geometers of this age . Wren appointed Edward Bernard as his deputy in the chair in 1669 , on his appointment as Surveyor of the King 's Works , and Bernard succeeded him four years later\"", "Edward Bernard,1673-91,St John 's College,St John 's College,\"Bernard studied Hebrew , Arabic , Syriac and Coptic with Edward Pococke ( Laudian Professor of Arabic at the university ) and mathematics with John Wallis ( Savilian Professor of Geometry ) . When Christopher Wren was appointed as Surveyor of the King 's Works in 1669 , he appointed Bernard as his deputy in the astronomy chair ; he succeeded Wren in 1673 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on the same day . Bernard 's interests , as demonstrated in his lectures , were more in ancient mathematics and astronomy than in modern developments ; he published comparatively few works . Tiring of his academic duties , he moved to Paris to tutor two of the illegitimate sons of King Charles II , the Duke of Grafton and the Duke of Northumberland , but returned after falling out with their mother , the King 's mistress . He unsuccessfully sought other positions abroad , including the chair of Arabic at the University of Leiden . He resigned in 1691 when appointed to a lucrative parish position as rector of Brightwell-cum-Sotwell near Oxford\"", "David Gregory,1691-1708,\"Marischal College and University of Aberdeen , and Leiden University\",Balliol College,\"Gregory studied in his native Scotland and befriended the Edinburgh physician Archibald Pitcairne before travelling through Europe and continuing his education . He inherited the papers of his uncle James Gregory , a mathematician and astronomer , which he studied carefully . He succeeded his uncle at the University of Edinburgh in 1683 , giving a history of the progress of mathematics as his inaugural lecture . In 1690 , Gregory refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the regime of William III and Mary II but was not removed from his post . He enlisted the support of Isaac Newton and John Flamsteed , the Astronomer Royal , in his efforts to obtain the Oxford chair , and was elected in December 1691 , becoming a Fellow of Balliol and obtaining an Oxford doctorate in February 1692 . As professor , he lectured less often than required by the terms of his appointment , and covered only relatively uncomplicated material rather than Newton 's work . He moved to London in 1704 and was appointed overseer of the Scottish Mint in 1707 to supervise recoinage in Scotland . He died in 1708 . He has been described as not a notable observational astronomer , but instead a talented correspondent , communicator and teacher\"", "John Caswell,1709-12,Wadham College,Hart Hall,\"Carswell matriculated at Wadham College , Oxford , when he was 16 years old , and studied with John Wallis ( Savilian Professor of Geometry ) . He worked with the cartographer John Adams on the survey of England and Wales that Adams began in the late 17th century . He was also vice-principal of Hart Hall , and wrote a book on trigonometry\"", "John Keill,1712-21,University of Edinburgh and Balliol College,Balliol College,\"Keill studied in Edinburgh with David Gregory and moved to Balliol with him in 1691 when Gregory was appointed as the Savilian astronomy professor . An accomplished pupil of Gregory , Keill was the first to teach a course on Newtonian principles at Oxford or Cambridge , lecturing in experimental philosophy at Hart Hall . He began deputising for Thomas Millington ( Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy ) in 1699 but after Millington died in 1704 Keill was not appointed as his successor , nor were his hopes of succeeding Gregory realised . After serving in various government roles , including decipherer to Queen Anne , he was elected to succeed Carswell . Described as one of the most influential natural philosophers in Britain for his work on Newtonian principles . he was one of the first to suggest that there might be attractions between invisible particules within matter that caused states such as elasticity and fluidity . His publications included his lectures on astronomy\"", "James Bradley,1721-62,Balliol College,-,\"Bradley was the nephew of James Pound , a leading astronomer who was a colleague of Edmond Halley and Isaac Newton , and helped his uncle with his observations near London even when Bradley was appointed as vicar of a church in Monmouthshire . He had a particular interest in the moons of Jupiter , correcting errors in published astronomical tables , Mars and nebulae , and was highly regarded by Halley . Bradley resigned as a clergyman on appointment to the chair in 1721 . His major discovery , in 1725 , was the aberration of light , in which stars appeared to move position as the earth moved , which led him to be able to calculate the speed of light and the time it took to travel from the Sun to the Earth . He moved to the Savilian professors ' house in 1732 , and succeeded Halley as Astronomer Royal in 1742 , improving the state of the buildings and instruments at the Greenwich observatory . His continued observations on the positions of the stars ( to help with navigation ) , the moon , and comets led to the discovery of nutation : the nodding of the Earth on its axis as it travelled around the Sun . He recorded observations for 18 years to measure the phenomenon , which helped to show ( as Newton argued ) that the earth was flatter at the poles . He was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society for this work . He carried on his astronomical observations , receiving many honours from home and abroad , until his death in 1762 . Legal disputes about whether the state or his inheritors owned his papers led to a long delay in publication of his papers , but they eventually formed the starting point for further important work about the positions of the stars\"", "Thomas Hornsby,1763-1810,Corpus Christi College,Corpus Christi College,\"Hornsby , who had an observatory at Corpus Christi , gained a high reputation for his lectures , and was the first Savilian astronomy professor required to provide courses each year . He presented papers about the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769 and the solar eclipse of 1764 to the Royal Society , of which he was a Fellow . He proposed that an observatory should be built at Oxford for the professor , and construction of the Radcliffe Observatory ( and an adjoining house for him ) began in 1772 . The observatory began operation in 1774 and was completed in 1797 . He was called upon to prepare the papers of his predecessor , James Bradley , for publication , but ill-health and his other duties as astronomy professor , experimental philosophy professor ( from 1763 ) , Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy ( from 1782 ) and Radcliffe Librarian ( from 1783 ) caused delays . He has been described as a lucid lecturer and a remarkably accurate observer\"", "Abraham Robertson,1810-26,Christ Church,Christ Church,\"Robertson started studying at Oxford aged 24 , having previously run ( unsuccessfully ) an evening school in Oxford for mechanics . He was supported by John Smith ( Savilian Professor of Geometry 1766-96 ) , for whom he deputised in 1784 before succeeding him in 1797 . He held the post of Radcliffe Observer in addition to the astronomy chair . Robertson was well-regarded as a lecturer , noted for his clarity and the assistance he gave in encouraging students . He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1795 to mark his work on conic sections ( the subject of his main work , Sectionum conicarum libri septem , in 1792 ) and his literary attainments and diligence in the pursuit of science . He also oversaw publication of an edition of the works of Archimedes\"", "Stephen Rigaud,1827-39,Exeter College,-,\"Rigaud , whose father was the observer at Kew Observatory , made his first recorded observations in astronomy when at Exeter College , and was elected to a fellowship of the college when still an undergraduate . From about 1805 , he substituted for Thomas Hornsby , astronomy professor and reader in experimental philosophy , because of Hornsby 's illness . When Abraham Robertson succeeded Hornsby in 1810 , Rigaud was appointed as Savilian Professor of Geometry ; he succeeded his father at Kew in 1814 , becoming joint observer with his grandfather . He succeeded Robertson in the astronomy and experimental philosophy positions in 1827 . His wife died in the same year , and Rigaud devoted himself to his children and his work ; he has been described as the foremost historian of astronomy and mathematics in his generation , and as renowned for his personal and scholarly integrity\"", "George Johnson,1839-42,The Queen 's College,The Queen 's College,\"Johnson was a mathematician and priest with little practical knowledge of astronomy . His appointment led to the Radcliffe Trust , which oversaw the Radcliffe Observatory , appointing Manuel Johnson as the Radcliffe Observer instead . George Johnson became White 's Professor of Moral Philosophy in 1842 and then Dean of Wells in 1854 , where his time was marred by a dispute about his unpopular decision to hold a parish position in Wells in addition to the deanery to supplement his income\"", "William Donkin,1842-69,St Edmund Hall and University College,University College,\"Donkin , a talented linguist , mathematician and musician , published papers on various astronomical and mathematical topics , including the movements of the Moon . He found new ways of solving Laplace 's equation and applied his mathematical knowledge to questions of acoustics , although he did not finish a proposed book on the topic before his death\"", "Charles Pritchard,1870-93,University of Cambridge ( St John 's College ),New College,\"After leaving Cambridge , Pritchard was headmaster of a grammar school in Stockwell , south London , but left after a year because of disagreements with the school 's owners about his wish to teach science . His reforms were popular with some of the parents , however , and they established a school for him nearby in Clapham , where he was headmaster from 1834 to 1862 and installed an observatory and other scientific equipment . He was a member , and later president , of the Royal Astronomical Society , taking part in observations and the 1860 expedition to Spain to observe the solar eclipse . An ordained priest , he was appointed Hulsean lecturer at Cambridge in 1867 , but never held a parish post . At the age of 62 , he was appointed to the Savilian chair and ( in the words of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography ) entered upon his new duties with the ardour of youth . During his time in the position , an observatory was built in the University Parks , making Oxford one of the leading observatories in Europe . His use of photography to assist his observations and calculations of stellar parallax was rewarded with the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society ( 1886 ) and the Royal Medal of the Royal Society ( 1892 )\"", "Herbert Turner,1893-1930,University of Cambridge ( Trinity College ),New College,\"Turner was second wrangler ( achieved the second-highest marks in the Cambridge mathematics examinations ) in 1882 , and became chief assistant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory in 1884 . He was involved with an international project to conduct a photographic survey and catalogue of stars , and devised a method of calculating a star 's true position , making the work much easier . This was recognised by the award of the Bruce Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific ( 1927 ) . After his appointment to the Oxford professorship , his attempts to have a house built for him at the university 's observatory were unsuccessful , as the dispute between the university and the Radcliffe Observatory that had begun with George Johnson 's appointment in 1839 continued . He supported the decision of the Radcliffe trustees to move their observatory to a better site , in South Africa , in 1929 , but was attacked by fellow Oxford academics in the struggles for improving science facilities at the university thereafter . He was heavily involved in the work of the Royal Astronomical Society and international astronomical groups , and developed interests in geophysics and seismology , where he was one of the first to suggest that the earth 's core was liquid\"", "Harry Plaskett,1932-60,\"University of Toronto and Imperial College , London\",New College,\"Plaskett , a solar physicist , was the son of the Canadian astronomer John Stanley Plaskett . After serving in the Canadian Corps during the First World War , he studied spectroscopy with Alfred Fowler at Imperial College for a few months before taking up an appointment under his father at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory , British Columbia . He taught at Harvard College from 1928 , becoming professor of astrophysics in 1930 , and concentrated on solar research ( which he preferred to lecturing ) . During this time he met the Oxford mathematician and astrophysicist Edward Arthur Milne , and they became close friends . On the death of Herbert Turner in 1930 , Milne warned Plaskett about the antiquated observatory at Oxford and the lack of university support and resources for the work of the Savilian professor , but Plaskett was undeterred and was appointed to the position . He constructed England 's first solar tower telescope to attract new researchers to Oxford , and reduced the work carried out at the observatory on seismology that Turner had begun , eliminating it in 1946 . He ended undergraduate tuition at the observatory and , with Milne , set up the first school of astrophysics in the country , based on the teaching of graduate students through research initiatives . He retired in 1960 , but continued his observations with his successor 's permission until he turned eighty in 1973 . Like his father , he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society\"", "Donald Blackwell,1960-88,University of Cambridge ( Sidney Sussex College ),New College,\"Blackwell was assistant director of the Solar Physics Observatory at Cambridge from 1950 to 1960 , when he took up the Savilian professorship . He was President of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1973 to 1975 , and visited various countries for his research\"", "George Efstathiou,1988-97,Keble College and the University of Durham,New College,\"After completing his studies at Oxford and Durham , Efstathiou worked as an astronomy research assistant at the University of California Berkeley for one year , then became a Fellow of King 's College , Cambridge . Before his appointment as Savilian professor , he was Assistant Director of Research at the Institute of Astronomy , Cambridge . After nine years in Oxford , he returned to Cambridge to take up a professorship , and became Director of the university 's Kavli Institute for Cosmology in 2008 . He has been awarded the Maxwell Medal and Prize of the Institute of Physics ( 1990 ) and the Gruber Prize in Cosmology ( 2011 )\"", "Joseph Silk,1999-2012,University of Cambridge ( Clare College ) and Harvard University,New College,\"After obtaining his doctorate from Harvard , Silk returned to England to carry out research at the Institute of Astronomy , Cambridge . After a year at the Princeton University observatory , he moved to the University of California at Berkeley in 1970 , becoming Professor of Astronomy in 1978 . His astronomical interests include the formation of galaxies , dark matter detection , and temperature changes in space . His publications include The Big Bang ( 1980 ) and A Short History of the Universe ( 1994 )\""], "metadata": {"uid": "Savilian_Professor_of_Astronomy_0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savilian_Professor_of_Astronomy", "title": "Savilian Professor of Astronomy", "section_title": "List of professors", "section_text": ".mw-parser-output .mod-gallery { display : table } .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery-default { background : transparent ; margin-top:0.5em } .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery-center { margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto } .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery-left { float : left } .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery-right { float : right } .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery-none { float : none } .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery-collapsible { width:100% } .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .title , .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .main , .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .footer { display : table-row } .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .title > div { display : table-cell ; text-align : center ; font-weight : bold } .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .main > div { display : table-cell } .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .caption { display : table-row ; vertical-align : top } .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .caption > div { display : table-cell ; display : block ; font-size:94% ; padding:0 } .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .footer > div { display : table-cell ; text-align : right ; font-size:80% ; line-height:1em } .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .gallerybox .thumb img { background : none } .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .bordered-images img { border : solid # eee 1px } .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .whitebg img , .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .gallerybox div { background : # fff ! important } John Greaves , professor 1643–48 , also an Orientalist who surveyed the Great Pyramid of Giza .

It was founded (at the same time as the Savilian Professorship of Geometry) by Sir Henry Savile, a mathematician and classical scholar who was Warden of Merton College, Oxford, and Provost of Eton College. He appointed John Bainbridge as the first professor, who took up his duties in 1620 or 1621. There have been 21 astronomy professors in all; Steven Balbus, the professor as of 2015[update], was appointed in 2012. Past professors include Christopher Wren (1661-73), architect of St Paul's Cathedral in London and the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford; he held the professorship at the time of his commission to rebuild the cathedral after it was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666. Three professors have been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society: Charles Pritchard (1870-93), Harry Plaskett (1932-60) and Joseph Silk (1999-2012). The two Savilian chairs have been linked with professorial fellowships at New College, Oxford, since the late 19th century.

The race was organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation, was shown on television in 72 countries, with the total viewers estimated at one billion. Following the success of Bernard Hinault in the previous edition, the team was heavily favored. Hinault promised to return Greg LeMond's support to win the 1985 Tour, however, continuing attacks cast doubt on Hinault's sincerity. He claimed that his tactics were simply to wear down LeMond's (and his) opponents and that he ultimately knew that LeMond would be the winner because of time losses earlier in the race. Regardless of his true motives, this tactic worked well, and rivals Laurent Fignon of and 's Urs Zimmermann were put on the defensive from the first day. Fignon quit the race due to injuries aggravated by stress. The ascent of the legendary Alpe d'Huez gave spectators a spectacular stage in which Hinault made a risky solo attack to demoralize the opposition, to be matched only by LeMond at the top. In a gesture of respect, the two riders reached the top hand-in-hand, beaming smiles, and LeMond let Hinault finish first to claim the stage. However, within hours LeMond and Hinault were interviewed together on joint television, where Hinault stated that the race was not over, seemingly betraying his teammate LeMond."}}

Its membership constituted a majority of the chamber's 49 members, allowing it to take control of the Senate from the Democratic caucus whose members had previously formed a majority. The MCC, operating much like a coalition government, offered an equal number of committee leadership positions to Republicans and Democrats. Senate Democrats accepted only three of the nine positions offered them. The Republicans strengthened their position by gaining one seat in the 2013 election, but lost its majority following a special election in November 2017. The coalition has 23 Republicans and one self-identified Democratic senator, Tim Sheldon. On November 15, 2017 the Majority Coalition Caucus returned to being the state Senate Republican Caucus."}}

It was the ninth round of the 2004 Formula One season. Rubens Barrichello started from pole position in his Ferrari ahead of teammate Michael Schumacher. However, following a start-line incident between five cars, four of whom retired as a result, Schumacher overtook Barrichello on the safety car restart on lap six, and despite a threat from Barrichello after the final pit stops, Schumacher held on to take his eighth win of the season. Takuma Sato became only the second Japanese driver to achieve a podium finish. The race saw two serious accidents caused by Michelin tyre failures in what would be a precedent for the 2005 United States Grand Prix, at which all Michelin-shod cars withdrew over safety concerns. First, Fernando Alonso's Renault speared off the track at the end of the pit straight on lap nine. Later, Ralf Schumacher's Williams suffered the same fate, but in the most dangerous part of the track, causing him to hit the wall at a ninety-degree angle rearwards. The impact left Schumacher with spinal fractures and concussion, which prevented him from racing until the 2004 Chinese Grand Prix, three months later."}}

Although it spans three different competitions, the premierships are considered historically equivalent. From 1956 to 1971, the first VFL Night Series was a consolation knock-out competition held in September at the Lake Oval in Albert Park amongst the eight teams who failed to reach the finals in the VFL premiership season, apart from 1957, when all twelve teams competed. There were no official VFL night series held during the 1972 to 1976 seasons, however in 1976 the National Football League (the national governing body at the time) held their own night series mid-week during the season, known as the NFL Wills Cup. In 1977, the VFL revived their own night series, also held mid-week during the season and televised on Channel 7 to rival the NFL series that was shown on Channel 10. Whilst the 1977 series only featured the twelve VFL teams, between 1978 and 1986 a selection of teams from the SANFL, WAFL and representative teams from Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania also competed. This became known as the Australian Football Championships Night Series and ran until 1987. With the national expansion of the VFL to include teams from Western Australia and Queensland the 1987 series was restricted to only the 14 VFL teams and commenced during the pre-season period, but was completed mid-week between rounds 5 and 6 of the 1987 VFL season. From 1988 until 2013, the competition was played in its entirety before the premiership season began and is competed for by only the VFL or AFL teams (the VFL was renamed the AFL in 1990), and became the Australian Football League pre-season competition. The preseason competition was abandoned in 2014, and replaced with discrete practice matches."}}

Below this level, leagues are split between those for clubs directly affiliated to the Argentine Football Association (mainly clubs from Greater Buenos Aires, but also some from the rest of the Buenos Aires Province and the Santa Fe Province), and those affiliated indirectly through their local leagues to the Association (covering the rest of the country). Clubs below the Primera B Nacional who are directly affiliated play in the Primera B Metropolitana, Primera C and Primera D, while those indirectly affiliated play in the Argentino A, Argentino B and Argentino C. \n These leagues make up the first five tiers of Argentine football. Below the fifth tier, there are various regional leagues for clubs indirectly affiliated. On the other hand, clubs directly affiliated have no league below the fifth (Primera D), therefore a club relegated from the Primera D has to spend one year without playing (disaffiliated)."}}

Case citations are formatted differently in different jurisdictions, but generally contain the same key information. A legal citation is a reference to a legal precedent or authority, such as a case, statute, or treatise, that either substantiates or contradicts a given position. Where cases are published on paper, the citation usually contains the following information:\nIn some report series, for example in England, Australia and some in Canada, volumes are not numbered independently of the year: thus the year and volume number (usually no greater than 4) are required to identify which book of the series has the case reported within its covers. In such citations, it is usual in these jurisdictions to apply square brackets to the year (which may not be the year that the case was decided: for example, a case decided in December 2001 may have been reported in 2002). The Internet brought with it the opportunity for courts to publish their decisions on websites and most published court decisions now appear in that way. They can be found through many national and other websites, such as WorldLII, that are operated by members of the Free Access to Law Movement. The resulting flood of unpaginated information has led to numbering of paragraphs and the adoption of a medium-neutral citation system. This usually contains the following information:\nRather than utilizing page numbers for pinpoint references, which would depend upon particular printers and browsers, pinpoint quotations refer to paragraph numbers. The conjunction versus is abbreviated to v in Commonwealth countries and to v. in the United States."}}

The awards are held annually and initially provided a tax-free prize of A$100,000 in each category, making it Australia's richest literary award in total. In 2011, the prize money was split into $80,000 for each category winner and $5,000 for up to four short-listed entries. The award was initially given in four categories - fiction, non-fiction, young adult and children's fiction - as selected by three judging panels. In 2012, a poetry category was added and the former Prime Minister's Prize for Australian History was incorporated into the award. The awards are open to works written by Australian citizens and permanent residents. Authors, publishers and literary agents are eligible to enter works, first published in the calendar year prior to the awards."}}

Those functions are a subset of the ones delegated to a core city. This category was established by the Local Autonomy Law, article 252 clause 26. They are designated by the Cabinet after a request by the city council and the prefectural assembly. Because the level of autonomy delegated to special cities is similar to that for core cities, after consultation with local governments the category of special cities was abolished in the revision of the Local Autonomy Act enacted on April 1, 2015, and cities with a population of at least 200,000 may now apply to be directly promoted to core city status. Special cities which have not been promoted may still retain autonomy, and are called special cities for the enforcement period (施行時特例市, Shikōji Tokurei shi). As a special case, within five years of the abolishment of the category of special cities, i.e. before April 1, 2020, special cities with a population under 200,000 may also apply to be promoted to core city status. The special cities are not the same as the special wards of Tokyo. They are also different from special cities (特別市, tokubetsu-shi) that were legally established in the Local Autonomy Law between 1947 and 1956, but never implemented. They would have been prefecture-independent cities (in an analogous way, special wards are city-independent wards). They were the legal successors to the 1922 six major cities (roku daitoshi; only five were left in 1947 as Tokyo City had been abolished in the war) and precursors to the 1956 designated major cities which have expanded autonomy, but not full independence from prefectures."}}

The five nominated films (highlighted in bold) came from Czechoslovakia, Hong Kong, Iceland, Sweden and the eventual winner, Mediterraneo, from Italy. Hong Kong and Iceland received their first-ever nominations, while Czechoslovakia received its final nomination as a unified state. Germany caused controversy when it took the unusual step not to submit any film to the competition. Europa, Europa by Agnieszka Holland was one of the pre-selection favorites to win the award. Although the film was made in German and about Germany, the country's National Film Board said that because they considered the film to be a majority-French production, and because the director was Polish, they did not consider it qualified to represent Germany. This is the only time since 1977 that Germany failed to be represented. Other countries notable by their absence included Brazil, Egypt, Finland, Greece and Romania. In spite of a rule requiring films to be in the language of the submitting country, AMPAS decided to accept a submission from the United Kingdom that was mostly in Russian, marking the UK's first-ever participation in the competition. AMPAS acknowledged that they had received four submissions from new Eastern European republics, Armenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia, which had each declared independence in mid-to-late 1991. Since none of the countries had yet been recognized internationally, the films were disqualified and not screened, although representatives from their parent states- the USSR and Yugoslavia- were allowed to compete. AMPAS did not announce the titles, but based on the small size of these republic's film industries at the time it appears certain that Macedonia chose Stole Popov's Tetoviranje, the most celebrated Yugoslavian film of 1991, and that Croatia, Slovenia and Armenia likely chose family drama Fragments, black comedy The Cartier Operation and surreal religious drama The Voice in the Wilderness respectively."}}

Caritoux, a second year professional, had shown his climbing talent earlier that year by winning the stage up the Mont-Ventoux of the 1984 Paris-Nice but he did not enter the 1984 Vuelta a Espana thinking of the overall classification. On the 12th stage to Lagos de Covadonga an area in Asturias which includes one of the most important climbs of the Vuelta, Caritoux finished second behind the German Raimund Dietzen who was also riding his first Vuelta a España. Caritoux took the leaders jersey from Pedro Delgado. Alberto Fernández was 32 seconds behind Caritoux in the general classification at that stage. Fernández had been third the year previously in the Vuelta a España and in the Giro d'Italia. On the stage 14 mountain time trial, Caritoux lost five seconds. Caritoux lost further time in the final individual time trial but still managed to finish the race with a slender lead of six seconds over Fernández, the smallest margin in the history of the Vuelta a España, and also the smallest ever seen in a Grand Tour.

His replacement Pep Clotet, formerly assistant manager at Leeds United, in contrast to Appleton's policy of signing promising young British players, signed a mix of foreign players, among them Dwight Tiendalli, Xemi Fernández, Ivo Pękalski, Agon Mehmeti and Ricardinho (the first Brazilian to play for Oxford), and seasoned British pros including Jonathan Obika from rivals Swindon Town, James Henry, Mike Williamson and John Mousinho.

Striker Kane Hemmings and defender Charlie Raglan were given season-long loans at Mansfield Town and Port Vale respectively. Curtis Nelson was appointed club captain following the departure of Lundstram. Results started reasonably with an away win over Oldham Athletic (who were to be relegated at the end of the season) and a home win over Portsmouth in front of what turned out to be the club's largest home crowd of the season. After 15 games the club were in the play-off places, but form declined through the late autumn. Curtis Nelson ruptured his Achilles tendon during a home defeat to Northampton Town in November, and John Mousinho was appointed captain in his place (until Nelson's eventual return in April). Oxford suffered a record 7-0 home defeat at the hands of eventual champions Wigan Athletic on 23 December."}}

It is also a pun on the title of Petra's irrelevance and age, who at the time had been performing for nearly twenty-five years, by rejecting comparisons of the band with extinct dinosaurs. The album was released by Star Song Records in 1996. They worked with the band during most of the 1980s through part of the band's most successful tenure."}}

The chart grew from a weekly top 10 list in 1956 to become a top 200 in May 1967, and acquired its present title in March 1992. Its previous names include the Billboard Top LPs (1961-72), Billboard Top LPs & Tapes (1972-84), Billboard Top 200 Albums (1984-85) and Billboard Top Pop Albums. The chart is based mostly on sales (both at retail and digital) of albums in the United States. The weekly sales period was originally Monday to Sunday when Nielsen started tracking sales in 1991, but since July 2015, tracking week begins on Friday (to coincide with the Global Release Date of the music industry) and ends on Thursday. A new chart is published the following Tuesday with an issue post-dated to the Saturday of that week, four days later. The chart's streaming schedule is also tracked from Friday to Thursday."}}

The types that affect the nervous system are also known as acute porphyria, as symptoms are rapid in onset and last a short time. Symptoms of an attack include abdominal pain, chest pain, vomiting, confusion, constipation, fever, high blood pressure, and high heart rate. The attacks usually last for days to weeks. Complications may include paralysis, low blood sodium levels, and seizures. Attacks may be triggered by alcohol, smoking, hormonal changes, fasting, stress, or certain medications. If the skin is affected, blisters or itching may occur with sunlight exposure. Most types of porphyria are inherited from one or both of a person's parents, and are due to a mutation in one of the genes that make heme. They may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked dominant manner. One type, porphyria cutanea tarda, may also be due to increased iron in the liver, hepatitis C, alcohol, or HIV/AIDS.

Almost all of Ontario's 2,700 km (1,678 mi) border with the United States follows inland waterways: from the westerly Lake of the Woods, eastward along the major rivers and lakes of the Great Lakes/Saint Lawrence River drainage system. These include Rainy River, Pigeon River, Lake Superior, St. Marys River, Lake Huron, St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, Detroit River, Lake Erie, Niagara River, Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River from Kingston, Ontario, to the Quebec boundary just east of Cornwall, Ontario. There is only about 1 km (0.6 mi) of land border, made up of portages including Height of Land Portage on the Minnesota border. Ontario is sometimes conceptually divided into two regions, Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario. The great majority of Ontario's population and arable land is in the south. In contrast, the larger, northern part of Ontario is sparsely populated with cold winters and heavy forestation."}}

Their next album, Between the Sheets (1993), reached number one, went gold, and received a Grammy Award nomination.

Contemporary society uses a vast array of electronic devices built in automated or semi-automated factories operated by the industry. Products are primarily assembled from metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistors and integrated circuits, the latter principally by photolithography and often on printed circuit boards. The size of the industry and the use of toxic materials, as well as the difficulty of recycling has led to a series of problems with electronic waste. International regulation and environmental legislation has been developed in an attempt to address the issues. The electronics industry consists of various sectors. The central driving force behind the entire electronics industry is the semiconductor industry sector, which has annual sales of over as of 2018. The largest industry sector is e-commerce, which generated over in 2017. The most widely manufactured electronic device is the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), invented in 1959, which is the workhorse of the electronics industry."}}

The first record of the community is a decree of Charles IV from 1338 , in which the administrators of the town were ordered to protect the Jews . The community built a synagogue , and , in 1432 , bought land for a cemetery . For a long period , there was peaceful cooperation and trade between Jews and Christians — until 1504 , when charges of desecration of hosts led to the expulsion of all Jews from Plzeň . Nevertheless , some Jews managed to settle in the town in the early 19th century illegally . In 1821 a total of 32 resided in Plzeň without permit . This changed drastically in 1848 , when the Austrian monarch lifted residence restrictions for Jews in the whole empire . Now , Jews came back to attend the Plzeň markets and to officially take residence in the town . By 1854 , the Jewish population of the town had jumped to 249 . In 1856 , a Jewish cemetery was consecrated . In 1859 , a synagogue was inaugurated . In spite of anti-Jewish riots of 1866 , the Jewish population continued to grow — and reached the number 1,207 in 1870 . At the beginning of the 20th century the Jewish community of Plzeň was among the largest and most affluent in Bohemia . It could afford to construct a large synagogue in the Moorish style , built in 1893 , called the Great Synagogue . The first lodge of Bnai Brith in Bohemia was founded in town . [ 67 ] Since 1918 , the community employed two rabbis , one for Czech services , the other one for German language services . The community was quite diverse then , ideologically the Jews of Plzeň were split into three groups , the Czech nationalist Jews , the German assimilationists and the Zionists . In 1920 , a severe and years-long controversy on kosher slaughtering broke out , when it was declared illegal for humanitarian reasons . Although the Supreme Court abolished this kind of prohibition in 1934 , attempts to reintroduce Shechita failed , due to the price difference . In 1921 , the Jews of Plzeň numbered 3,117 . But thereafter the Jews population declined to 2,773 in 1930 ( 2.4% of the total population ) . After the annexation of Sudetenland by Hitler 's Reich in the fall of 1938 , many Jews from these regions arrived in the city . [ 67 ] They felt in safety , but this changed drastically when Hitler Germany invaded the rest of Bohemia and Moravia in March 1939 . The so-called Nuremberg Laws were also put in effect in the so-called Protectorate , Jews in Plzeň were gradually deprived of their civil rights and liberties , their social status , their property and employment . They were treated like inferiors and exposed to degrading repressions on administrative , psychological and physical levels . [ 68 ] One of the last letters of Robert Auer ( born in Plzeň ) and his wife Ernestine , both murdered by the Nazi regime In January 1942 , at least two thousand of Plzeò citizens of all professions , all social classes and all ages ( workers , craftsmen , tradesmen , bankers , lawyers , teachers , physicians , officials , housewives , children and elderly persons ) were interned in the Sokol building in Štruncovy Sady and deported from town after several days . They were labelled `` Jews '' by the Nazis on the basis of their genealogical origin — not considering their faith nor their national or denominational feeling . They were forced to wear the yellow badge on the left side of the coats . Also interned and then deported were 540 Jews from nearby areas – men , women and children from Blovice , Hořovice , Kralovice , Manětín , Radnice , Rokycany and Zbiroh . The three deportation trains left Plzeò railway station within ten days , their destination was Theresienstadt concentration camp : 17 January : transport T with 1,000 deportees ( murdered : 927 , survived : 73 ) . [ 69 ] 22 January : transport S with 1,004 deportees ( murdered : 937 , survived : 67 ) . [ 69 ] 26 January : transport T with 609 deportees ( murdered : 543 , survived : 66 ) . [ 70 ] The Pilsen deportation trains with 2,613 persons were among the first to arrive in Theresienstadt . The youngest was Eva Fischerová , eight months old , the oldest was Marie Ebenová from Rokycany , nearly 90 . [ 71 ] [ 71 ] Most of the deportees had to walk from the Bohušovice railway station about two and a half kilometers to the camp , carrying children and luggage in the severe cold . There , families were separated , the living conditions in the barracks were gruesome , the food scarce . By the end of 22 January people of old age perished , among them Marie Ebenová . Already in March of the same year two transports , Aa and Ab , each containing 1,000 people , were sent from Thersienstadt to the Izbica Ghetto . 620 of them were men , women and children from the Pilsen region . Additional 700 persons from the region were deported to ghettos , concentration camps and extermination camps in eastern Poland , Belorussia , Estonia and Latvia . On 26 October 1942 the first transport to Auschwitz left the camp . By the end of the year , not even one-third of the deportees was alive . More than 1,800 men , women and children had been murdered within the first eleven months after deportation . Only 206 of the Pilsen deportees could survive the Shoah . Today , a little more than 70 Jews live in Plzeň .", "intro": "The Stolpersteine in the Plzeňský kraj lists the Stolpersteine in the Plzeň Region () in the western part of Bohemia. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist Gunter Demnig. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide. Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self-chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: Kameny zmizelých, stones of the disappeareds."}}

Early Tour riders consumed alcohol and used ether, among other substances, as a means of dulling the pain of competing in endurance cycling. Riders began using substances as a means of increasing performance rather than dulling the senses, and organizing bodies such as the Tour and the International Cycling Union (UCI), as well as government bodies, enacted policies to combat the practice. Use of performance-enhancing drugs in cycling predates the Tour de France. Cycling, having been from the start a sport of extremes, whether of speed by being paced by tandems, motorcycles and even cars, or of distance, the suffering involved encouraged the means to alleviate it. Not until after World War II were sporting or even particularly health issues raised. Those came shortly before the death of Tom Simpson in the Tour de France of 1967. Max Novich referred to the Tour de France in a 1973 issue of New York State Journal of Medicine as a cycling nightmare. Journalist Hans Halter wrote in 1998 that For as long as the Tour has existed, since 1903, its participants have been doping themselves. For 60 years doping was allowed. For the past 30 years it has been officially prohibited. Yet the fact remains; great cyclists have been doping themselves, then and now."}}

Ever since a 1980 interpretation of the 1884 Antideficiency Act, a lapse of appropriation due to a political impasse on proposed appropriation bills requires that the US federal government curtail agency activities and services, close down non-essential operations, furlough non-essential workers, and only retain essential employees in departments covering the safety of human life or protection of property. Voluntary services may only be accepted when required for the safety of life or property. Shutdowns can also occur within and disrupt state, territorial, and local levels of government. Since the enactment of the US government's current budget and appropriations process in 1976, there have been a total of 22 funding gaps in the federal budget, 10 of which have led to federal employees being furloughed. Prior to 1980, funding gaps did not lead to government shutdowns, until Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued a legal opinion requiring the government be shut down when a funding gap occurs. This opinion was not consistently adhered to through the 1980s, but since 1990 all funding gaps lasting longer than a few hours have led to a shutdown. Some of the most significant shutdowns in U.S. history have included the 21-day shutdown of 1995-1996 during the Bill Clinton administration over opposition to major spending cuts; the 16-day shutdown in 2013 during the Barack Obama administration caused by a dispute over implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; and the 35-day shutdown of 2018-2019 during the Donald Trump administration, the longest shutdown in US history, caused by a dispute over the funding amount for an expansion of the U.S.-Mexico border barrier. Shutdowns cause the disruption of government services and programs, including the closure of national parks and institutions (in particular, due to shortages of federal employees). A major loss of government revenue comes from lost labor from furloughed employees who are still paid, as well as loss of fees that would have been paid during the shutdown. Shutdowns also cause a significant reduction in economic growth (depending on the length of the shutdown). During the 2013 shutdown, Standard & Poor's, the financial ratings agency, stated on October 16 that the shutdown had to date taken $24 billion out of the economy, and shaved at least 0.6 percent off annualized fourth-quarter 2013 GDP growth."}}

From 2015 to 2017, she appeared as a regular cast member on the VH1 reality television series Love & Hip Hop: New York to follow her music aspirations, and released two mixtapes - Gangsta Bitch Music, Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, before signing with label Atlantic Records in early 2017. Cardi B has since earned three number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100; Bodak Yellow made her the second female rapper to top the chart with a solo output - following Lauryn Hill in 1998, I Like It made her the only female rapper to attain multiple number-one songs on the chart, and her Maroon 5 collaboration Girls Like You made her the sixth female artist to achieve three number-one singles on the chart during the 2010s. Her debut studio album, Invasion of Privacy (2018), on which the former two songs are included, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, broke several streaming records and was certified triple platinum by the RIAA. Critically acclaimed, the album won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, making Cardi B the only woman to win the award as a solo artist. Recognized by Forbes as one of the most influential female rappers of all time, Cardi B is known for her aggressive flow and candid lyrics, which have received widespread media coverage. She is the highest certified female rapper of all time on the RIAA's Top Artists (Digital Singles) ranking, also appearing among the ten highest-certified female artists of all time.

They marked the first major development of the basic pre-dreadnought type that had been developed with the type of the mid-1890s, all of which had been designed by the Director of Naval Construction, William Henry White, with the primary innovation being the adoption of a heavy secondary battery of four guns to supplement the standard main battery of four guns. The King Edward VIIs were among the last pre-dreadnoughts built for the Royal Navy before the construction and launch of the revolutionary battleship HMS Dreadnought in 1906, which immediately rendered them obsolescent. The ships served with the Atlantic Fleet from 1905 to 1907, when they were transferred to the Channel Fleet, though this service lasted only until 1908-1909, when they were reassigned to the Home Fleet. During this period, King Edward VII served as fleet flagship as a result of a request from her namesake that she always serve as such. Africa and Hibernia were involved with experiments with seaplanes in 1912, and that year all members of the class were assigned to the 3rd Battle Squadron of the Home Fleet and were later sent to the Mediterranean Sea to respond to the First Balkan War. By the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the King Edward VIIs were sent to the Grand Fleet to support the Northern Patrol and to conduct sweeps in the North Sea for German warships, though they never saw combat. In January 1916, King Edward VII struck a German naval mine and sank, though her crew was safely evacuated. By mid-1916, the surviving ships were no longer suitable for front-line fleet service, and so they were dispersed to other tasks, including coastal defence with the Nore Command and for operations in the Gallipoli Campaign. Africa was sent to the Atlantic Patrol in 1917 and was later stricken with Spanish flu, and Britannia was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat two days before the end of the war, one of the last British warships to be sunk in the conflict. The surviving members of the class were all sold for scrap in the early 1920s."}}

The Washington Redskins franchise was founded as the Boston Braves, named after the local baseball franchise. The team changed their name to the Redskins in 1933 and moved to Washington, D.C. in 1937. Every year during April, each NFL franchise seeks to add new players to its roster through a collegiate draft known as the NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting, which is more commonly known as the NFL Draft. Teams are ranked in inverse order based on the previous season's record, with the worst record picking first, and the second worst picking second and so on. The two exceptions to this order are made for teams that appeared in the previous Super Bowl; the Super Bowl champion always picks 32nd, and the Super Bowl loser always picks 31st. Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks, players, cash, or a combination thereof. Thus, it is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades. The Boston Redskins were one of the nine original franchises that participated in the 1936 NFL Draft, which was the first official draft of the National Football League. The first player ever selected in the draft, Heisman Trophy winner Jay Berwanger, chose not to play professional football. Riley Smith, taken second overall by the Redskins, holds the distinction of being the first drafted player to play in the NFL. The Redskins also hold the distinction of being the only team to draft the same player in two different drafts, Cal Rossi."}}

The 2009 edition was the first played at a neutral site, namely Orleans Arena in Paradise, Nevada, just outside Las Vegas. The semifinals are broadcast nationally on ESPN2 and the championship is broadcast nationally on ESPN. The tournament has used several formats in its history, though seeding in all formats has been based strictly on conference record (with tiebreakers used as needed). When the tournament began in 1987, when the conference had eight members, it used a standard single-elimination bracket that was reseeded after the first round so that the highest and lowest remaining seeds played one another in the semifinals. Beginning in 2003, the bottom four seeds played first-round games (5 vs. 8, 6 vs. 7), with the 3 and 4 seeds receiving byes to the quarterfinals and the top two seeds receiving byes to the semifinals. For the 2012 tournament, the first after the 2011 arrival of BYU in the WCC, this format was adjusted so that the 8 and 9 seeds played in the first round, with the winner joining the 5 through 7 seeds in the second round, and the top four seeds continuing to receive byes into the quarterfinals (3 and 4) or semifinals (1 and 2). In addition, reseeding was abolished, with the top seed automatically playing the winner of the quarterfinal game featuring the 4 seed and the 2 seed automatically playing the winner of the quarterfinal game featuring the 3 seed. Beginning in 2014, the WCC adopted a new format to incorporate a tenth team (Pacific). The new format is a traditional 10-team tournament."}}

It was founded in 1963 as Florida Technological University with the goal of providing highly trained personnel to support the Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Florida's Space Coast. After the university's academic scope expanded in the mid and late 1970s to encompass a wider variety of disciplines, the school was renamed The University of Central Florida in 1978. Initial enrollment in 1968 was 1,948 students; as of 2014, the university has 59,770 students from more than 140 countries, all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Since the university's first graduating class in 1970, UCF has awarded more than 250,000 degrees, including 45,000 graduate and professional degrees, to over 200,000 alumni. UCF alumni have made research contributions to optics, modeling and simulation, digital media, engineering and computer science, business administration, education and hospitality management. Among the most notable are Gene Frantz('71), inventor of the Texas Instruments Speak and Spell, and father of digital signal processing. Numerous graduates have gained notoriety in the fields of law, government, and public policy, with alumni including a prime minister, a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, a United States assistant secretary of state, a deputy assistant secretary at the Department of the Treasury, a director of the National Reconnaissance Office, and a director of the Secret Service; in addition to numerous members of the Florida Cabinet, Florida House of Representatives and Florida Senate, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts, and numerous officers in the armed forces through a unique partnership between the university and the U.S. military. Alumni have also achieved success as executives in major organizations and Fortune 500 companies, such as Boeing, Busch Entertainment Corporation, Darden Restaurants, Ericsson, Google, NASCAR, the Orlando Magic and Texas Rangers, Sun Sports and Fox Sports Florida, Raymond James Financial, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, and Yahoo! UCF graduates have also made notable contributions in the entertainment industry, including Cheryl Hines, widely known for her role as Cheryl David on the HBO television series Curb Your Enthusiasm, and Daniel Tosh, host of Tosh.0 on Comedy Central.

The House of Representatives consists of 400 members coming from 204 legislative districts across the state, created from divisions of the state's counties. On average, each legislator represents about 3,300 residents. Districts vary in number of seats based on their populations, with the least-populous districts electing only one member and the most populous electing 11. In multi-member districts, voters are allowed to cast as many votes as there are seats to be filled; for instance, in a two-member district, a voter can vote for up to two candidates. This system often results in one party winning all of the seats in the district, as the (cross-sectional) results below for the current representation attest. Unlike in many state legislatures, there is no single aisle to cross per se, as members of both parties sit partially segregated in five sections. The seat section and number is put on the legislator's motor vehicle license plate, which they pay for if they wish to put one on their personal automobiles, or in the case of the chairpersons and party leaders, their title is put on the legislative plate. Seating location is enforced, as seating is pre-assigned, although the personal preference of the legislator is asked, usually chairmen and those with special needs are given the preferred aisle seats. The sixth section is the Speaker's seat at the head of the hall. The House of Representatives has met in Representatives Hall of the New Hampshire State House since 1819. Representatives Hall is thus the oldest chamber in the United States still in continuous legislative use."}}

[ 8 ]", "intro": "Shaqtin' a Fool is a weekly segment from the television show Inside the NBA, the postgame show of NBA on TNT following the conclusion of National Basketball Association (NBA) games airing on cable TV channel TNT. The title is a play on actin' a fool. It first aired during the 2011-12 NBA season, when retired NBA All-Star Shaquille O'Neal voiced it upon joining the show and was created by Turner Sports producer Mike Goldfarb. It highlights humorous and uncommon basketball plays that have occurred during NBA games in the past week. O'Neal is the host and presenter, while the other analysts in studio react and provide commentary. Most often, those have been fellow Inside regulars Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley, but other Inside hosts have also participated, including Chris Webber, Grant Hill, Steve Smith, Kevin Garnett and Matt Winer. The segment regularly features NBA players and also includes, but is not limited to, coaches, referees, fans, mascots, and other arena employees. Sometimes they also air clips from other international basketball leagues. On special occasions, the segment features plays which had occurred during the past, including several entire retro editions. Each episode tends to have five entries from the past week, with each entry typically involving a single play (although there are some times where a collection of similar bad plays, such as travels and air ball free throws, are highlighted). Multiple plays may include the same player, and a single play may highlight more than one player. There is a special award given to certain players, called the Shaqtin Golden Ticket, which is lifetime immunity from being included in the segment."}}

It is the tallest freestanding structure in the United Kingdom, seventh-tallest freestanding structure and fourth-tallest tower in Europe outside Russia, and 24th-tallest tower in the world. The tower's current official name, The Arqiva Tower, is shown on a sign beside the offices at the base of the tower, but it is commonly known just as Emley Moor. In March 2018 a temporary mast was erected so that work could be undertaken on the main tower's transmitting arrays without interrupting transmissions.

United tried to salvage a poor showing last season where they finished at the bottom of the MLS standings. The season covers the period of 1 November 2010 through 31 October 2011. Ahead of the preseason, then interim-head coach Ben Olsen assumed head coaching duties, under a three-year contract for an undisclosed price. Olsen became the first head coach in franchise history to both play for and coach the squad. Upon retiring as a player on 24 November 2009 Olsen became an assistant coach under head coach Curt Onalfo. On 7 August 2010 Olsen was named interim head coach after Onalfo was fired. Olsen finished the 2010 season with a 3-8-1 record. Several major offseason acquisitions were made, in both the offense and defense. Notable signings included Charlie Davies on loan, Perry Kitchen, Dax McCarty and Josh Wolff. In the summer, a major trade was made when United traded McCarty to their Atlantic Cup rivals, New York Red Bulls, for Dwayne De Rosario. During the MLS regular season, United regularly hovered in the middle of the league's overall table, frequently swapping positions barely in or outside of a berth in the MLS Cup Playoffs."}}

The Ethiopian calendar is a solar calendar which in turn derives from the Egyptian calendar, but like the Julian calendar, it adds a leap day every four years without exception, and begins the year on August 29 or August 30 in the Julian calendar. A gap of 7-8 years between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternative calculation in determining the date of the Annunciation. Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopic calendar has 12 months of 30 days plus 5 or 6 epagomenal days, which comprise a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez. A 6th epagomenal day is added every 4 years, without exception, on August 29 of the Julian calendar, 6 months before the corresponding Julian leap day. Thus the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1 Mäskäräm, for years between 1900 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually September 11 (Gregorian). However, it falls on September 12 in years before the Gregorian leap year."}}

They beat Roma on penalties to win the European Cup for the fourth time (their sixth European trophy win overall), and defeated Merseyside rivals Everton in the League Cup final replay, and fought off a challenge from the likes of Southampton, Nottingham Forest, Manchester United and Queen's Park Rangers to win their 15th league title, and their third consecutive title. The undoubted star of the season was striker Ian Rush, who scored 32 goals in the league and 47 in all competitions. It was the last season at the club for midfielder Graeme Souness, who was sold to Italian side Sampdoria at the end of the campaign."}}

Both in the earliest Slavic religion and in modern Slavic Native Faith's theology and cosmology, gods are arranged as a hierarchy of powers begotten by the supreme God of the universe, Rod, known as Deivos in the earliest Slavic religion. According to Helmold's Chronica Slavorum (compiled 1168-1169), obeying the duties assigned to them, [the deities] have sprung from his [the supreme God's] blood and enjoy distinction in proportion to their nearness to the god of the gods. The general Slavic term for god or deity is бог bog, whose original meaning is both wealth and its giver. The term is related to Sanskrit bhaga and Avestan baga. Some Slavic gods are worshipped to this day in folk religion, especially in countrysides, despite longtime Christianisation of Slavic lands, apart from the relatively recent phenomenon of organised Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery). Slavic folk belief holds that the world organises itself according to an oppositional and yet complementary cosmic duality through which the supreme God expresses itself, represented by Belobog (White God) and Chernobog (Black God), collectively representing heavenly-masculine and earthly-feminine deities, or waxing light and waning light gods, respectively. The two are also incarnated by Svarog-Perun and Veles, whom have been compared to the Indo-Iranian Mitra and Varuna, respectively. All bright male gods, especially those whose name has the attributive suffix -vit, lord, are epithets, denoting aspects or phases in the year of the masculine radiating force, personified by Perun (the Thunder and Oak). Veles, as the etymology of his name highlights, is instead the god of poetic inspiration and sight. The underpinning Mokosh (Moist), the great goddess of the earth related to the Indo-Iranian Anahita, has always been the focus of a strong popular devotion, and is still worshipped by many Slavs, chiefly Russians."}}

The race has had several different calendar dates, running before in September, June and May. Since 2010 it has been on the calendar in late March as part of the UCI World Tour. Raced over seven days, it covers the autonomous community of Catalonia in Northeast Spain and contains one or more stages in the mountain region of the Pyrenees. The race traditionally finishes with a stage in Barcelona, Catalonia's capital, on a circuit with the famous Montjuïc climb and park. First held in 1911, the Volta a Catalunya is the fourth-oldest still-existing cycling stage race in the world. Only the Tour de France (1903), the Tour of Belgium (1908) and the Giro d'Italia (1909) are older. It was the second cycling event organized on the Iberian peninsula, only after the amateur and sub-23 race Volta a Tarragona (1908), equally held in Catalonia but no longer on the calendar. Catalan cycling icon Mariano Cañardo won the race seven times in the 1920s and 1930s, setting an unsurpassed record."}}

It was also the first time that two girls faced off each other in the final 2 showdown making Jorun Stiansen the first female winner over Tone Damli Aaberge. Aaberge would attempt to represent Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2009 where she ended up being the runner-up, this time to Alexander Rybak who later went on to win the contest. Ironically Rybak has also been a contestant on Idol 2005 and in the same semifinal group as Aaberge. However while Aaberge went on winning her group, Rybak did not even manage to reach the top 5 and therefore missed out a spot in the group of final 12. Second runner-up Alejandro Fuentes was able to top VG-lista (Norwegian Single Charts) three times between 2005 and 2007. One if these no. 1 Hits was a collaboration with Askil Holm, Espen Lind and Kurt Nilsen (winner of season one). The quartet also went on tour under the name The New Guitar Buddies."}}

Riccardo Patrese finished second for the Williams team, with Thierry Boutsen third in the other Williams car. This race would become one of the most notorious in F1 history, as the culmination of Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna's tumultuous two year rivalry as teammates at McLaren. The Japanese Grand Prix decided the 1989 Drivers' Championship in Prost's favour, after a collision on lap 46 at the final chicane between him and Senna put them both off the track. While Prost abandoned his stalled car, Senna restarted his, made a pit stop to change his front wing, and overhauled Alessandro Nannini to take victory. Following the race Senna was controversially disqualified for using the chicane's escape road to rejoin the circuit, handing the title to Prost."}}

Dick includes 44 novels, 121 short stories, and 14 short story collections published by American science fiction author Philip K. Dick (December 16, 1928 - March 2, 1982) during his lifetime. At the time of his death, Dick's work was generally known to only science fiction readers, and many of his novels and short stories were out of print. To date, a total of 44 novels have been published and translations have appeared in 25 languages. Six volumes of selected correspondence, written by Dick from 1938 through 1982, were published between 1991 and 2009. The Library of America has issued three collections of Dick's novels. The first, published in June 2007, contained The Man in the High Castle, The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Ubik, and was the first time science fiction was included in the LOA canon. The second collection was issued in July 2008, and included Martian Time Slip, Dr. Bloodmoney, Now Wait for Last Year, Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said, and A Scanner Darkly. The third collection was published in July 2009 and included A Maze of Death and the VALIS trilogy (VALIS, The Divine Invasion, and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer). At least nine films have been adapted from Dick's work, with Blade Runner (1982) widely considered a masterpiece. Five recurring philosophical themes in Dick's work have been classified by Philip K. Dick scholar Erik Davis: false realities, human vs. machine, entropy, the nature of God, and social control. In Understanding Philip K. Dick, Eric Carl Link discussed eight themes or 'ideas and motifs': Epistemology and the Nature of Reality, Know Thyself, The Android and the Human, Entropy and Pot Healing, The Theodicy Problem, Warfare and Power Politics, The Evolved Human, and 'Technology, Media, Drugs and Madness'."}}

In March 1912, during the 13th session of the IOC, Belgium's bid to host the 1920 Summer Olympics was made by Baron Édouard de Laveleye, president of the Belgian Olympic Committee and of the Royal Belgian Football Association. No fixed host city was proposed at the time. The 1916 Summer Olympics, to be held in Berlin, capital of the German Empire, were cancelled due to World War I. The aftermath of the war and the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 affected the Olympic Games not only due to new states being created, but also by sanctions against the nations that lost the war and were blamed for starting it. Hungary, Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire were banned from competing in the Games. Germany did not return to Olympic competition until 1928 and instead hosted a series of games called Deutsche Kampfspiele, starting with the Winter edition of 1922 (which predated the first Winter Olympics). The United States won the most gold and overall medals. The sailing events were held in Ostend, Belgium, and two in Amsterdam, Netherlands."}}

The first 5 sites inscribed in the UNESCO Heritage List was initiated by ICOMOS Philippines, an non-profit heritage organization, which partnered with the UNESCO National Commission of the Philippines and the Heritage Conservation Society. The Philippines has a cultural inventory, called the Philippine Registry of Cultural Property or PRECUP, and a natural inventory called the National Integrated Protected Areas System or NIPAS. Both of which were established by various Philippine laws. The intangible cultural heritage list of the Philippines is under the PRECUP. In 2015, the 28 sites in the 'Tentative List' were revised.

S. Gilbert and music by Arthur Sullivan. It was the British duo's third operatic collaboration. The plot of The Sorcerer is based on a Christmas story, An Elixir of Love, that Gilbert wrote for The Graphic magazine in 1876. A young man, Alexis, is obsessed with idea of love levelling all ranks and social distinctions. To promote his beliefs, he invites the proprietor of J. W. Wells & Co., Family Sorcerers, to brew a love potion. This causes everyone in the village to fall in love with the first person they see and results in the pairing of comically mismatched couples. In the end, Wells must sacrifice his life to break the spell. The opera opened on 17 November 1877 at the Opera Comique in London, where it ran for 178 performances. It was considered a success by the standards of that time and encouraged the collaborators to write their next opera, H.M.S. Pinafore. The Sorcerer was revised for an 1884 revival, and it is in that version that it is usually performed today. The Sorcerer was the first Savoy opera for which the author and composer had nearly total control over the production and the selection of cast."}}

Stockton was born in San Bernardino, California. He attended the University of Southern California and turned professional in 1964. His first PGA Tour win came at the 1967 Colonial National Invitation. He was selected by former Colonial champions as one of two Champion's Choice invitations; he is the only Champion's Choice invitee to win the Colonial in the year of the invitation. His best year was 1974, when he won three times, but his two majors, both of which were PGA Championships, came in 1970 and 1976. In 1970 he played the final round with Arnold Palmer, shooting a seventy-three which included an eagle and a double-bogey on the seventh and the eighth holes, and making a bogey on the thirteenth despite putting a ball in the water. In the end, this effort was good enough for a two stroke victory over Palmer and Bob Murphy. Due to rain at the 1976 PGA Championship, which was held at the Congressional Country Club, the final round had to be delayed until Monday. Stockton sank a fifteen-foot par putt at the seventy-second hole to avoid a three-man playoff with Raymond Floyd and Don January. Stockton joined the Senior PGA Tour (now the Champions Tour) in 1991 and enjoyed continued success, topping the Senior Tour money list in 1993 and 1994. His fourteen senior titles include three senior majors, the 1992 and 1994 Senior Players Championships and the 1996 U.S. Senior Open."}}

The activities of EUMETSAT contribute to a global meteorological satellite observing system coordinated with other space-faring nations. Satellite observations are an essential input to numerical weather prediction systems and also assist the human forecaster in the diagnosis of potentially hazardous weather developments. Of growing importance is the capacity of weather satellites to gather long-term measurements from space in support of climate change studies.

He is considered as one of the most popular singers of Indian film industry and from soft numbers to peppy tracks to romantic moods, Kumar sang in different genres but some of his rare compositions which were considered classics were lost in time. According to Ashok Kumar, Kumar's success lies in the fact that his voice used to hit the microphone straight at its most sensitive point. Apart from Hindi, he sang in many Indian languages including Bengali, Marathi, Assamese, Gujarati, Kannada, Bhojpuri, Malayalam and Urdu. He has also sung in private albums in several languages especially in Bengali. He won 8 Filmfare Awards for Best Male Playback Singer and holds the record for winning the most Filmfare Awards in that category. He was awarded the Lata Mangeshkar Award by the Madhya Pradesh government in the year 1985-86. In the year 1997, the Madhya Pradesh Government initiated an award called the Kishore Kumar Award as a contribution to Hindi cinema. Recently, Kishore Kumar's unreleased last song was sold for Rs 1560,000 (1.56 million) at the Osian's Cinefan Auction, New Delhi in 2012."}}

It was the first season under the sponsorship of the Clydesdale Bank. Gretna were promoted from the First Division the previous season and played in the SPL for the first time, replacing Dunfermline Athletic. Gretna did not play at their home stadium Raydale Park as it did not meet the SPL stadia criteria of 6,000 and instead used Motherwell's Fir Park for all but one of their games; that match was at Livingston's Almondvale Stadium. Champions Celtic qualified directly for the Champions League, while second-placed Rangers qualified for the Second qualifying round. Third-placed Motherwell qualified for the UEFA Cup and Hibernian qualified for the Intertoto Cup. First Division side Queen of the South also qualified for the UEFA Cup after reaching the Scottish Cup Final.

Humans normally have two copies of chromosome 22 in each cell. Chromosome 22 is the second smallest human chromosome, spanning about 49 million DNA base pairs and representing between 1.5 and 2% of the total DNA in cells. In 1999, researchers working on the Human Genome Project announced they had determined the sequence of base pairs that make up this chromosome. Chromosome 22 was the first human chromosome to be fully sequenced. Human chromosomes are numbered by their apparent size in the karyotype, with Chromosome 1 being the largest and Chromosome 22 having originally been identified as the smallest. However, genome sequencing has revealed that Chromosome 21 is actually smaller than Chromosome 22."}}

The team compete in League Two, the fourth tier of the English football league system. They are the only professional football club in England to wear claret and amber, and have worn these colours throughout their history. They have though been known by various nicknames, with the Bantams being the most commonly used nickname as it appears on the current club crest. Supporters hold West Yorkshire derby rivalries with Huddersfield Town and Leeds United, as well as an historic Bradford derby rivalry with the now non-league side Bradford (Park Avenue). The club's home ground is the 25,136-capacity Valley Parade, which was the site of the Bradford City stadium fire on 11 May 1985, which took the lives of 56 supporters. The club was founded in 1903 and immediately elected into the Football League Second Division. Promotion to the top tier followed as they won the 1907-08 Second Division title and then they went on to win the 1911 FA Cup Final, which remains the club's only major honour. They were relegated in 1922 and again in 1927, before winning the Third Division North title in 1928-29. Another relegation in 1937 did allow the club to go on to win the Third Division North Cup in 1939, however a further relegation followed in 1962 to leave the club in the newly created Fourth Division. They secured promotions back into the third tier in 1969 and 1977, but were relegated in 1972 and 1978. They found success in the 1980s under the stewardship of first Roy McFarland and then Trevor Cherry, winning promotion in 1981-82 and following this up with the Third Division title in 1984-85, though they were relegated out of the Second Division in 1990."}}

The first national race of Belgium was held in 1925 at the Spa region's race course, an area of the country that had been associated with motor sport since the very early years of racing. To accommodate Grand Prix motor racing, the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps race course was built in 1921 but until 1924 it was used only for motorcycle racing. After the 1923 success of the new 24 hours of Le Mans in France, the Spa 24 Hours, a similar 24-hour endurance race, was run at the Spa track. Since its inception, Spa-Francorchamps has been known for its unpredictable weather. At one stage in its history it had rained at the Belgian Grand Prix for twenty years in a row. Frequently drivers confront a part of the course that is clear and bright while another stretch is rainy and slippery. The Belgian Grand Prix was designated the European Grand Prix six times between 1925 and 1973, when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe. It is one of the most popular races on the Formula One calendar, due to the scenic and historical Spa-Francorchamps circuit being a favourite of drivers and fans."}}

It is the music equivalent to the Premio Regia Televisiva for television, the Premio Ubu for stage performances, and the Premio David di Donatello for motion pictures, but with a longer history and contest associated with. The first edition of the Sanremo Music Festival, held between 29 and 31 January 1951, was broadcast by RAI's radio station Rete Rossa and its only three participants were Nilla Pizzi, Achille Togliani and Duo Fasano. Starting from 1955 all the editions of the Festival have been broadcast live by the Italian TV station Rai 1. From 1951 to 1976, the Festival took place in the Sanremo Casino, but starting from 1977, all the following editions were held in the Teatro Ariston, except 1990's one, held at the Nuovo Mercato dei Fiori. Between 1953 and 1971, except in 1956, each song was sung twice by two different artists, each one using an individual orchestral arrangement, to illustrate the meaning of the festival as a composers' competition, not a singers' competition. During this era of the festival, it was custom that one version of the song was performed by a native Italian artist while the other version was performed by an international guest artist., and that was the way for many international artists to debut with hits in Italian market in those years, such a case for Louis Armstrong, Stevie Wonder, Jose Feliciano, Roberto Carlos, Paul Anka, Yardbirds, Marianne Faithfull, Shirley Bassey, Mungo Jerry and many others. The festival is used as the way of choosing the Italian entry to the Eurovision Song Contest and it has launched the careers of some of Italy's most successful singers, including Andrea Bocelli, Paola e Chiara, Il Volo, Giorgia, Laura Pausini, Eros Ramazzotti, and Gigliola Cinquetti."}}

In most instances, thirteeners refers only to those peaks between 13,000 and 13,999 feet in elevation. The importance of thirteeners is greatest in Colorado, which has the majority of such peaks in North America with over 600 of them. Despite the large number of peaks, over 20 peak baggers have reported climbing all of Colorado's thirteeners. Thirteeners are also significant in states whose highpoints fall between 13,000 and 13,999 feet. Regarding whether or not peaks in excess of 13,999 feet should be considered as thirteeners, this article will count them as such for statistical purposes, but concentrate its focus on those peaks less than 14,000 feet since the higher peaks are already covered in the fourteeners list. Not all summits over 13,000 feet qualify as thirteeners, but only those summits that mountaineers consider to be independent. Objective standards for independence include topographic prominence and isolation (distance from a higher summit), or a combination. However thirteener lists do not always consistently use such objective rules. A rule commonly used by mountaineers in the contiguous United States is that a peak must have at least of prominence to qualify. According to the Mountaineering Club of Alaska, it is standard in Alaska to use a prominence rule rather than a 300-foot rule. These are the standards applied for the lists below."}}

The season was very successful on the field as the Saints began by winning the inaugural President's Cup and the Leinster Senior Cup. The biggest triumph of all however was when top scorer Christy Fagan wrote himself into the club's history books by scoring twice in a 2-0 win over Derry City in the 2014 FAI Cup Final, ending a 53-year hoodoo with the cup for the club.

The Carolina Panthers, who had the worst record for the 2010 NFL season at 2-14, had the right to the first selection in the draft, where they selected Auburn University quarterback Cam Newton, who was the 2010 Heisman Trophy winner. A second Heisman Trophy winner, running back Mark Ingram Jr. from Alabama was selected by New Orleans late in the first round. This was the eleventh draft which included multiple Heisman winners, and the first time ever that it has occurred in consecutive drafts (Sam Bradford and Tim Tebow in 2010). Five of the first six picks played college football in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). For the second consecutive year - and the third time in NFL history - the top two selections of the draft won Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year awards, respectively. The top two picks in the draft, Cam Newton and Denver linebacker Von Miller, played against each other in Super Bowl 50 on the teams that drafted them. This marked the first time that the top two picks in a single draft faced each other in the Super Bowl. The Broncos won, 24-10, with Miller winning Super Bowl MVP. Teams were allowed ten minutes to make each selection in the first round, seven minutes per selection in the second round and five minutes in each of the subsequent rounds. The time allotment ran out for the Baltimore Ravens on their first round pick, allowing the Kansas City Chiefs to move up to the 26th pick and dropping the Ravens to the 27th pick."}}

As of 2019, the WSOP consists of 90 events, with most major poker variants featured. However, in recent years, over half of the events have been variants of Texas hold 'em. Events traditionally take place during one day or over several consecutive days during the series in June and July. However, starting in 2008, the Main Event final table was delayed until November. The 2012 and 2016 Main Event final tables commenced in October because of the United States presidential election. As of May 2017, the World Series of Poker has done away with the November Nine concept and instead gone back to the old format of crowning the Main Event winner in July."}}

Sweeping across the peninsula in September 2014, Odile inflicted widespread damage, particularly in the state of Baja California Sur, in addition to causing lesser impacts on the Mexican mainland and Southwestern United States. The precursor to Odile developed into a tropical depression south of Mexico on September 10 and quickly reached tropical storm strength. After meandering for several days, Odile began to track northwestward, intensifying to hurricane status before rapidly reaching its Category 4 hurricane peak intensity on September 14. The cyclone slightly weakened before making landfall near Cabo San Lucas with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). Odile gradually weakened as it tracked across the length of the Baja California Peninsula, briefly crossing into the Gulf of California before degenerating into a remnant system on September 17. These remnants tracked northeastward across the Southwestern United States before they were no longer identifiable on September 19. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast that Odile would track westward and avoid land as it would curve out to sea. Accordingly, the local governments of southwestern Mexico initially posted minor weather alerts. Precautionary measures on the Baja California Peninsula began in earnest after Odile unexpectedly took a direct course towards the peninsula. Several municipalities declared a state of emergency, opening 164 shelters with a total capacity of 30,000 people. Due to the unanticipated threat of Odile, approximately 26,000 foreign tourists were stranded on the peninsula at the time of landfall."}}

MMP replaced the first-past-the-post (FPP) system New Zealand had previously used for most of its history. New Zealand has a single-house legislature, the House of Representatives, usually with 120 members, although the number can increase because of (generally) one or two overhang seats, depending on the outcome of the electoral process. The 52nd Parliament, elected in 2017, has 120 seats: 71 were filled by electorate MPs, with the remaining 49 from ranked party lists.The term of the New Zealand Parliament is set at three years. In 1893, New Zealand was the first country in the world to give women the right to vote. This meant that theoretically, New Zealand had universal suffrage from 1893, meaning all adults 21 years of age and older were allowed to vote (in 1969 the voting age was lowered from 21 to 20. It was lowered again to 18 in 1974). However, the voting rules that applied to the European settlers did not apply to Māori, and their situation is still unique in that a number of seats in the New Zealand Parliament are elected by Māori voters alone. In contemporary New Zealand, generally all permanent residents and citizens over 18 are eligible to vote. The main exceptions are when a person has been living overseas continuously for too long, has been detained in a psychiatric hospital for more than three years after being charged with a criminal offence, or since 2010, is currently a sentenced prisoner."}}

All picnic areas had tall trees that provided shade and visual isolation from the roadway . Grills , benches , running water and restrooms were provided .

Its name refers to New Jersey's nickname, the Garden State. The parkway's official, but unsigned, designation is Route 444. At its north end, the road becomes the Garden State Parkway Connector, a component of the New York State Thruway system that connects to the Thruway mainline in Ramapo. At a length of , the parkway is the longest highway in the state. Most of the highway has a posted speed limit of . The parkway is primarily for passenger vehicle use; trucks weighing over are prohibited north of exit 105. The parkway was constructed between 1946 and 1957 to connect suburban northern New Jersey with resort areas along the Atlantic coast and to alleviate traffic on traditional north-south routes running through each town center, such as U.S. Route 1 (US 1), US 9, and Route 35. During planning, the road was originally designated as the Route 4 Parkway. Unofficially, the parkway has two sections: the metropolitan section north of the Raritan River and the shore section between the Raritan River and Cape May. Most of the metropolitan section is like any other expressway built in the 1950s through heavily populated areas. The shore section parallels US 9 and runs through unspoiled wilderness in the New Jersey Pine Barrens."}}

It is no longer active, but CD reissues on Virgin still mention the label and have Dindisc catalogue numbers. The imprint was founded and run by Carol Wilson, who had previously discovered Sting and signed him to Virgin's music publishing company. Talking about the signing of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark to Dindisc, she later said: OMD were a perfect fit for what I had in mind for DinDisc - they had a serious, artistic side with real depth, as well as a commercial, pop side. That duality was reflected in all the early DinDisc signings, like Martha and the Muffins, and then the Monochrome Set. Many of the company's sleeves were designed by the in-house designer Peter Saville. Saville had started at Factory Records, but came to Wilson's attention when she signed Factory band OMD; she had been particularly interested by Saville's thermographic paper sleeve for the Factory release of Electricity. Saville delivered the artwork for the Dindisc release of Electricity\nand asked Wilson if Dindisc needed an art director. Saville and Ben Kelly won a Designers and Art Directors Award for their work on the album Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. The label's first release (DIN-1) was Where's The Boy For Me by the Rezillos, released in September 1979. The label's most notable chart successes included Martha and the Muffins' Echo Beach (UK #5 in 1980) and several early singles by OMD, including Enola Gay, Souvenir, Joan of Arc and Maid of Orleans (The Waltz Joan of Arc) all of which hit the UK top 10 in 1980/81. The label ceased operations after the release of Hot Gossip's I Don't Depend On You (DIN-39) in February 1982, after Wilson failed to obtain a shareholding."}}

The inhabitants of Central America represent a variety of ancestries, ethnic groups, and races, making the region one of the most diverse in the world. Several of the countries have a predominance of mixed Amerindian-European, or mestizo, population, while a minority are more ininhabited by those of greater European ancestry.

As with the Arizona House of Representatives, members to the Senate are elected from the same legislative districts as House members, however one Senator represents the constituency, while for the House there are two Representatives per district. This districting system is similar to those of the Idaho and Washington State Senate. In political science, this type of legislative district is called a multi-member district. Like other upper houses of state and territorial legislatures and the federal U.S. Senate, the Senate can confirm or reject gubernatorial appointments to the state cabinet, commissions and boards. The Senate convenes in the adjacent legislative chambers at the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix."}}
